## A Minimal Soundsense for Dwarf Fortress

### Rationale

The vanilla soundsense takes up only 1.6mb, and comes with no sounds, this is fine.  
The default sound packs, however, are a wopping 300mb.  

This project aims to trim down the sounds required, balancing audial awareness and soundtrack with disc usage - you get discovery and alert sounds and a few seasonal tracks, the rest has to go.

### Usage

Download this repo.  
Extract the soundsense folder in your Dwarf Fortress directory.  
Run soundsense/SoundSense.exe before starting DF.
